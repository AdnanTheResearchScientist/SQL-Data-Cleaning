# SQL-Data-Cleaning

# Data Cleaning and Transformation:

This dataset includes financial transactions by various clients, encompassing client details, contact persons, departments, regions, payment methods, revenue, profit, and profit margin. However, to ensure accurate information presentation to my team, I employed a meticulous data cleaning process using SQL. This involved addressing specific issues within the dataset and refining it for clarity and precision. Through the application of SQL queries, I meticulously cleansed the data, identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, errors, and missing values. This proactive approach not only enhanced the overall quality of the dataset but also contributed to the reliability and accuracy of the subsequent analyses and insights derived from the financial transactions.


#### 1. Autofit Rows and Columns
   - **Problem:** Long rows
   - **Solution:** 
     - Selected all (CTRL + A), went to Format, and chose Autofit Row Height (Alt + H + O + I) for rows and Autofit Column Width (Alt + H + O + C) for columns.
   - **Result**: Resolved long rows, significantly enhancing overall readability.

#### 3. Find & Replace
   - **Problem:** Unnecessary Info
   - **Solution:**
     - Removed unnecessary info within parentheses by selecting the whole column, using Find & Select, and employing the Replace tool (CTRL + H).
     - Typed (*) to remove anything within parentheses, clicked Replace All, then closed.
   -**Result**: Enhanced data clarity by eliminating unnecessary information.

#### 4. Lower
   - **Problem:** All text is Uppercase, making it hard to read
   - **Solution:**
     - Created a new column (CTRL + Shift + Plus) and used '=LOWER' to convert text to lowercase.
     - Before deleting the old column:
       - Copied the converted column (CTRL + Shift + Down, then CTRL + C).
       - Pasted as Values (Alt + H + V + V).
       - Deleted the old column (CTRL + Minus).
   - **Result:** Improved readability by transforming all text to lowercase.

#### 5. Trim & Proper
   - **Problem:** Odd spacing and capitalization
   - **Solution:**
     - Created a new column (CTRL + Shift + Plus).
     - Used '=TRIM' to remove spacing and '=PROPER' to address random capitalization.
     - Alternatively, used '=TRIM(PROPER(Click on the cell you want to change))'.
     - Before deleting the old column:
       - Copied the converted column (CTRL + Shift + Down, then CTRL + C).
       - Pasted as Values (Alt + H + V + V).
       - Deleted the old column (CTRL + Minus).
   - **Result:** Ensured uniformity and coherence in the dataset.

#### 6. Text to Columns
   - **Problem:** Too much info in one column (department and state).
   - **Solution:**
     - Created a new column (CTRL + Shift + Plus) named Region.
     - Highlighted all rows I want to sparate.
     - Went to Data
     - Used Text to Columns to separate department and state information.
     - Clicked Next on the first prompt.
     - In the second prompt, I put underscore (_) and clicked finish.
   - **Result:** Enhanced data organization by splitting information into distinct columns.

#### 7. Removing Duplicates
   - **Problem:** Too many duplicate values
   - **Solution:**
     - Removed duplicate values by selecting all (CTRL + A) and using Remove Duplicates.
   - **Result:** Streamlined the dataset by mitigating redundancy.

#### 7. Filling Empty Cells
   - **Problem:** Blank rows or missing info
   - **Solution:**
     - Selected the entire table (CTRL + A).
     - Used Find & Select, "Go to Special" to select blanks (or CTRL + G, choose Speacial, check on Blanks) and filled them with 'NA' (CTRL + ENTER).
   - **Result:** Filled empty cells with 'NA,' ensuring a more comprehensive dataset by addressing missing values and maintaining data integrity..

#### 8. IFERROR
   - **Problem:** 'NA' errors in the Profit Margin column.
      - In the cell, type =IFERROR(put the cells you want to divde and put coma.
      - After coma, type inside double quatation marks "NA".
      - For example, the formula would be =IFERROR(M4/N4,"NA")and hit CTRL ENTER.
   - **Result:** Prevented disruptions in calculations caused by 'NA' errors.

#### 9. Formatting
   - **Format Headers and Rows:**
     - Highlighted headers (CTRL + SHIFT + Right) and made them bold (CTRL + B).
     - Changed colors using theme colors under Home.
   - **Result:** Enhanced visual appeal for improved presentation.

#### 10. Gridlines
   - **Problem:** Distracting grid lines
   - **Solution:**
     - Unchecked Gridlines in View (or Alt + W + V + G).
   - **Result:** Reduced distraction by hiding grid lines, improving focus on the dataset's content.

Finally, this comprehensive data cleaning and transformation process resulted in a polished dataset, making it more presentable, user-friendly, and conducive to effective analysis by the team.
